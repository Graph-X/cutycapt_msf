This software is provided as is and free of charge.  It can be redesigned, redistributed,
refrigerated, remade, reheated, and regifted in part or in whole by any person, corporation, rodent, or wet floor sign
for fun or profit or hookers and blow. Marsupials, and all other inanimate objects are prohibited from using this software.
In exchange, just give me credit for inspiring you to steal my code like Carlos Mencia steals jokes.  I steal a bunch too so you're probably just getting sloppy seconds anyways. Shout out to Stack Exchange/Overflow for giving me help via shitty code snippets whenever I got stuck.

Keep in mind I'm not a dev and can barely write good English let alone good code.  This software is likely buggy as hell 
and is provided AS IS with no warranty real, imagined, fabricated, fornicated or pulled from a magic hat that this software is 
suitable for any purpose, porpise, tortise, unless it's also a florist.  To be honest, you probably should not even use this in any environment in you want to have working right.

Basically don't sue me if you decide to use this code that I'm putting out there for free and it breaks shit  I'm just as broke as this code and you'll just be pissing into the wind on that endeavor.  I already warned you that my code is bad.  Read through it and make sure you know what it does, or have your cousin that took a web design class in high school help you figure out what it does.  Or just take my word for it and wing it. #YOLO

P.S. If the above license doesn't hold up in court (which is highly probable)  default to GNU v3 pubic license.
